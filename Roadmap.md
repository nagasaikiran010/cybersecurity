Here’s a **comprehensive classification of cybersecurity roles and activities**, divided into **Red Team** (offensive) and **Blue Team** (defensive):

---

## 🔴 **Red Team – Offensive Security**

> **Goal:** Simulate real-world attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities before real attackers do.

### 🔐 Penetration Testing

* Web, mobile, network, cloud, and API pentesting
* Social engineering (e.g., phishing)
* Physical security assessments

### 💉 Exploit Development

* Writing custom exploits (0day/1day)
* Fuzzing
* Binary exploitation

### 👾 Malware Development

* Custom payloads (e.g., C2 implants)
* Evasion techniques (AV/EDR bypass)
* Stagers/loaders/packers

### 🕵️ Adversary Emulation

* Threat actor simulation (e.g., APT behavior)
* TTP-based testing (MITRE ATT\&CK Red Teaming)
* Purple teaming collaboration

### 🧰 Tools & Techniques

* Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Sliver
* Custom C2 frameworks
* Post-exploitation (pivoting, lateral movement)

---

## 🔵 **Blue Team – Defensive Security**

> **Goal:** Detect, prevent, and respond to attacks, ensuring system resilience and business continuity.

### 🎯 Threat Detection

* SIEM tuning (e.g., Splunk, ELK, Sentinel)
* Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)
* YARA, Sigma rules

### 🔎 Threat Hunting

* Proactive identification of threats
* IOC/IOA correlation
* Use of threat intel feeds

### 🛡️ Incident Response

* Triage and containment
* Forensic analysis (disk, memory)
* Root cause and recovery

### 🧬 Malware Analysis

* Static and dynamic analysis
* Reverse engineering
* Behavior classification

### 🏗️ Security Architecture & Hardening

* Secure configurations (CIS, STIG)
* Network segmentation, firewalls, IDS/IPS
* Patch management

### 🧮 Risk Management & Compliance

* GRC, audits (ISO 27001, SOC 2, HIPAA)
* Business continuity planning
* Security awareness training

## 🟣 **Purple Team (Collaborative)**

Bridges the gap between red and blue teams:

* Aligns offensive testing with defensive improvements
* TTP mapping and real-time feedback
* Enables continuous security validation
